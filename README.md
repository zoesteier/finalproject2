[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/zoesteier/hw3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zoesteier/hw3)

Skeleton for Smith-Waterman project.

## assignment
1. Read in score matrices.
2. Implement Smith-Waterman algorithm


## structure

The main file that you will need to modify is `cluster.py` and the corresponding `test_cluster.py`. `utils.py` contains helpful classes that you can use to represent Active Sites. `io.py` contains some reading and writing files for interacting with PDB files and writing out cluster info.
