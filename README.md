# HW3 Skeleton

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/zoesteier/hw3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zoesteier/hw3)

Skeleton for Smith-Waterman project.

## assignment

1. Implement a similarity metric (metric in io.py, compute similarity in cluster.py)
2. Implement a clustering method based on a partitioning algorithm (used k means)
3. Implement a clustering method based on a hierarchical algorithm (used agglomerative clustering)
4. Answer the questions given in the homework assignment


## structure

The main file that you will need to modify is `cluster.py` and the corresponding `test_cluster.py`. `utils.py` contains helpful classes that you can use to represent Active Sites. `io.py` contains some reading and writing files for interacting with PDB files and writing out cluster info.

## usage

To use the package, first run

```
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

to install all the dependencies in `requirements.txt`. Then the package's
main function (located in `hw2skeleton/__main__.py`) can be run as
follows

```
python -m hw2skeleton -P data test.txt
```

## testing

Testing is as simple as running

```
python -m pytest
```

from the root directory of this project.
